## Project Description  
For this project you will be working in a **team**. You will have to choose a topic and find all the relevant data yourselves. This means you can connect to an API, find a dataset or scrape data from the web. Then you must organize, clean and (optional) analyze the data you found and present your findings in a presentation (you may use plots!).  

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Learn how to obtain data from different sources, including APIs, open source datasets and/or scrape data from the web.
* Practice how clean data using vectorized methods.
* Begin to practice basic plotting.

## Data Workflow
In this project you will focus on Data Extraction techniques, while you continue developing your Data Wrangling skills.

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are:
* The project must be planned. That is why creating a Kanban board and readme documentation is important. You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/kImhfE7w/data-projects).
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file and also have a functional file structure.
* Your project must include data from at least 2 different data sources (APIs & web, dataset & APIs, etc.).
* The project needs to be presented within 5 minutes to your colleagues on the day of the presentation.

The **deadline** to turn in the deliverables is Sunday at 23:59.

## Mentoring
The TAs will be your mentors!

Your mentors will:
* Keep track of your project in general terms. Your mentors will be the next people that know more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following your plan: are you keeping up with your tasks and deadlines? Do you have any obstacles blocking you?
* Help/support you with specific questions.

Your mentors are **not** meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your managers. You have to be responsible of your own tasks!

## Schedule  

**Please note** that the following schedule is simply a guideline. Feel free to organize your work as you see fit.

**Step 1**
* Choose a topic for your project.
* Find interesting questions related to your topic.
* Brainstorm to find out what kind of data you can use to answer those questions.
* Research and look for the data you need. Remember that you need to use at least two different sources.
* Create your own repo, assign your group members as contributors, and commit often. You can find a [template](https://github.com/ta-data-bcn/Project-Week-3-Data-Thieves/blob/master/your-project/README.md) for your README file in this repository. Remember to keep the README up-to-date.

**Step 2**
* Plan your project. Remember that we are providing you with a Trello [template](https://trello.com/b/kImhfE7w/data-projects). Define tasks, specifying those to be done individually and those to be done together. Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
* Once you finish, start coding!
* Clean your data.
* Design your database.

**Step 3**
* Design your presentation, focusing on techniques, trouble points, and workflow. Analysis and plotting are optional and should not be the focus of the presentation.

**Step 4**
* Presentation time at **14:00** on Friday! There will be a 1-minute dance break between groups!

## Necessary Deliverables
The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo and the link should be submitted via the student portal.

* **A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file**:
The structure should be:
1. Title of the project.
2. Introduction to hypothoses.
3. Data used (sources, limitations, cleaning, etc...)
4. Any analysis and plots created.
5. Any insights derived from your basic analysis.
6. Possible further questions and improvements.
* **A data folder**
* **A ``README.md`` file**  
Look [here](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for tips on how to structure a README.md file.


## Presentation
The presentation time limit is **5 minutes**! Our suggestion is to include at least the following slides in your presentation but feel free to add or remove slides:

* Title of the project
* Team presentation
* Goals of the project
* Data - sources, problems and limitations
* Database - data wrangling/cleaning and database structure
* Organization. Did you follow your workflow plan? Did you add something after starting the project? Did you follow your best practices agreements? Did you think about the risk management?
* Any insights
* Questions you were not able to answer and why
* Learnings

## Tips & Tricks  
* Questions first. Data second.
* Think about the workflow of your analysis BEFORE starting to code.
* You will have more questions than answers. It's not a problem if you can't answer some or any of your questions. Just show us why you couldn't answer them, that itself will be interesting!
