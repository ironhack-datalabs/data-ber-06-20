# Project: Visualizing Real World Data

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data as well as statistical analysis.

**You will be working in teams for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go.

Use the techniques you've learned about storytelling to effectively present (maximum 5 minutes) your findings.

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Select a dataset or multiple dataset from a public source.
 - Create Jupyter notebooks to analyze the data
 - Using your data, create a minimum of 4 types of plots (ie: scatter plot, histogram, box plot and bar graph), but you can add more than one visualization of each type of you choose. Graphs should contain the proper labeling of the x and y axis when appropriate as well as a title for the graph. All of the different graphs do not need to be in the presentation.
 - Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

- **Jupyter notebooks** containing your analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis. 
- **A data folder** containing your data set. If your data is to large for Github, please either use Google Drive or Github's Large File Storage. 
- **A README** describing your how you got your data, your hypothesis, your workflow, your notebook and data organization, and your insights gathered from your analysis. Checkout this [template](https://github.com/ta-data-bcn/Project-Week-3-Data-Thieves/blob/master/your-project/README.md) if you need help. 
- **A .gitignore file**

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Find a data set to process** - a great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). A great new source is the [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch).
* **Perform Analysis** - use functions like `describe` to help guide you to the correct insight and data visualization. 
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of the different types of visualizations and when to use them should come in handy with this assignment.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## Suggested Timeline
* **Pre-project** - decide on a topic and try to find a few datasets that could be used
* **Day 1-2** - clean and wrangle your data. Maybe add a new data source if you feel that you need it. 
* **Day 2-4** - start to analyze your data. Decide which statistical models you would like to use. Fit your models (be careful not to overfit!) and start plotting. Focus on good annotations that help people understand your thought process and what the data is showing. 
* **Day 3-5** - prep your presentation. This can be something you slowly start to think of during the analysis phase. It will help you to guide your analysis in a way that creates a story. Your audience could include visitors from the other bootcamps, so try to focus on understandable results instead of the actual statistical methods used. 
* **Day 5** - Present! Ideally you will spend most of Day 5 practicing your presentation and preparing for questions that people may ask!
* **Weekend** - Submit your Github repo by Sunday at 23:59 and get some well-deserved rest!

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectations, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
